Tools used:
  Android Studio
  OsmDroid
  3.2 HVGA slider(ADP1) API 22 (Android 5.1.1, API 22)

TASK:
Create a basic Android application with Kotlin that meets the following requirements:
* When started, the app shows a map (OpenStreetMap) with the user’s location pointed on it. There is an exit button to close the app.
* For testing purposes the user’s location can be mocked.
x The custom (non-library) code should be 100% covered with unit tests.
x The map (OpenStreetMap) should work offline. That is, the app can download a certain OSM area (a small city like Castelldefels) at
  startup and then the user is shown the map without ever making a request to the OSM servers.
